Virtual Directory system 

- /boot   - boot loader files  - The boot partition contains files used by the bootloader to load the operating system -  config-6.8.0-41-generic - a configuration file for the Linux kernel
- /etc    - configuration files (system & app)
- /home   - user files  - Each user in the system has a home directory to store personal files and preferences, and most of them are located under /home

- /var    - variable data - This directory contains “variable data”, or files and directories the system must be able to write to during operation. This includes system logs (in /var/log), temporary files (/var/tmp) and cached application data (in /var/cache).
- /dev -   very file inside this directory is associated with a system device, particularly storage devices.
- /proc - directory contains files with information regarding running processes and hardware resources.
  - All changes to files in /proc/ are immediately recognized by the kernel.
- /sys - 



- /      - This is the root directory, the topmost directory in the hierarchy. Every other directory is located inside it.

- /boot  - Files needed by the boot process, including the Initial RAM Disk (initrd) and the Linux kernel itself.
- /dev   - Device files.
- /etc   - Host-specific configuration files. Programs may create subdirectories under /etc to store  multiple configuration files if needed.
- /home  - Each user in the system has a “home” directory to store personal files and preferences,
- /lib   - Shared libraries needed to boot the operating system and to run the binaries under /bin and /sbin.
- /media - User-mountable removable media, like flash drives, CD and DVD-ROM readers,
- /mnt   - Mount point for temporarily mounted filesystems
- /opt   - Application software packages
- /root  - Home directory for the superuser (root).
- /run   - Run-time variable data.
- /sbin  - System binaries.
- /srv   - Data served by the system. For example, the pages served by a web server could be stored under /srv/www.
- /tmp   - Temporary files are files used by programs to store data that are only needed for a short time. - all filers removed after restart 
- /usr   - Read-only user data, including data needed by some secondary utilities and applications.
- /proc  - Virtual filesystem containing data related to running processes.
- /var   - Variable data written during system operation, including print queue, log data, mailboxes, temporary files, browser cache, etc.

REDIRECT 





0, STDIN  - cat < myfile 
1, STDOUT - all output - cat xfile > myfile  - 
2, STDERR - only error -cat not_exist_file >2 testerr  -   cat testerr    ->    cat: not_exist_file: No such file or directory



- echo "This is an error" >&2   - print text as STDERR -  redirect stdout to stderr  (>&2)         - echo "This is an error" >&2  >2 err1 
  -  > redirect standard output (implicit 1>)
  -  & what comes next is a file descriptor, not a file (only for right hand side of >)
  -  2 stderr file descriptor number
- echo "This is normal output"  - print text as STDOUT


So when you write git status 2&>1 

- the first 2 actually gets passed as an argument to git status.
- stdout is redirected to the file named 1 (not the file descriptor 1)
- stderr is redirected to the file named 1



To redirect stdout to stderr:
- echo test 1>&2 -  # equivalently, echo test >&2 - redirects stdout to stderr.

To redirect stderr to stdout:
- echo test 2>&1 - redirects stderr to stdout.

- >name means 1>name -- redirect stdout to the file name
- &>name is like 1>name 2>name -- redirect stdout and stderr to the file name

- command 2> - write error
  -  cat file_non_exist  2> test.txt   - cat: file_non_exist: No such file or directory



- command > - rewrite full file
  -  echo "10" > test.txt
- command >> - write in the end
  -  echo "3" >> test.txt

SUID - short for Set User ID - A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the file

- chmod 4xxx file_name - To set the SUID permission on a file - and xxx with the existing permission bits for the file.
  - chmod 4777 test4.txt
  - -rws rwx rwx 1 root root     0 Aug 31 14:16 test4.txt  ->  you will run this file as root user 
  -    S



SGID - This can be applied to executable files or
directories. On files, it will make the process run with the privileges of the group who owns the
file. When applied to directories, it will make every file or directory created under it inherit the
group from the parent directory.

- chmod 2xxx file/directory_name - To set the SGID permission on a directory 
  - chmod 2777 test1.txt
  -  chmod g+s test5.txt
  - -rwx rws rwx 1 root root     0 Aug 31 14:16 test1.txt -> you will run this file as group 
    -      S



Sticky Bit - This applies only to directories, and has no
effect on normal files. On Linux it prevents users from removing or renaming a file in a directory
unless they own that file or directory

- chmod 1xxx directory_name OR chmod +t directory_name
- drwxrwxrwt
  -        T







HARD AND SOFT LINK 



Reference Type: Soft links are references to the pathname of a file or directory, while hard links are references to the inode of a file.
Behavior on Original File Deletion: When the original file is deleted, a soft link pointing to it becomes invalid (dangling), whereas a hard link remains valid as it points directly to the inode of the file.
Cross-Filesystem Linking: Soft links can point to files or directories across different filesystems because they refer to pathnames. Hard links can only be made to files (not directories) within the same filesystem, as they link directly to inodes.
Visibility: When listing directory contents with ls -l, soft links show the path to which they point using an arrow notation (->), whereas hard links appear as regular files, showing no indication that they are links.

- ln target_file link_name - hard link
  - ln test1.txt /test1_link.txt  - create hard link - but not for read-only file 
    - the same inode 
    - if you delete test1.txt you  keep test1_link.txt

- ln -s target_path link_name
  - ln -s test2.txt /test2_link_soft.txt - create soft link 
    - not the same inode

- uptime -  show cpu load, time, how long the system are running -  'top' command can show the same 

17:07:17 up 7 days, 23:24,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

In a system with 2 CPUs, a load average of 2 means that all CPUs are fully occupied;
In a system with 4 CPUs, a load average of 2 means that 50% of the CPUs are idle.
In a system with 1 CPU, a load average of 2 means that the CPU is overloaded and half of the processes cannot compete for the processors' power.

The first value depicts the average load on the CPU for the last minute.
The second gives us the average load for the last 5-minute interval
The third value gives us the 15-minute average load

Systemd 

- service - The most common unit type, for active system resources that can be initiated, interrupted and
  reloaded.
- socket  - The socket unit type can be a filesystem socket or a network socket. All socket units have a
  corresponding service unit, loaded when the socket receives a request.
- device - A device unit is associated with a hardware device identified by the kernel.
- mount - A mount unit is a mount point definition in the filesystem, similar to an entry in /etc/fstab.
- automount - An automount unit is also a mount point definition in the filesystem, but mounted
  automatically. Every automount unit has a corresponding mount unit, which is initiated when
  the automount mount point is accessed
- target  - A target unit is a grouping of other units, managed as a single uni
- snapshot - A snapshot unit is a saved state of the systemd manager (not available on every Linux
  distribution).

DEBIAN SOFTWARE 


apt-get
  used to download, install, upgrade or remove packages from the system.

- apt-get update - automatically upgrade any installed packages to the latest versions available
  from the repositories.
- apt-get install procinfo
- apt-get install -f - It is possible to have “broken dependencies” on a system. This means that one or more of the
  installed packages depend on other packages that have not been installed, or are not present
  anymore. This will try to “fix” the broken packages
  by installing the missing dependencies, ensuring that all packages are consistent again.

- apt-get remove procinfo
- apt-get purge p7zip or apt-get remove --purge p7zip - Note that when a package is removed the corresponding configuration files are left on the system.
  To remove the package and any configuration files, use the purge parameter

- apt-get dist-upgrade  procinfo - will install the newest versions of all currently installed packages


apt-cache
  used to perform operations, like searches, in the package index.

- apt-cache depends procinfo -  show list the dependencies of package
- apt-cache search p7zip - The output will be a
  list of every package that contains the pattern, either in its package name, description or files
  provided.
- apt-cache show liblzma5 -  show the full information, including description
- apt-cache showpkg  procinfo

You can also use "apt search" instead of "apt-cache search" and "apt show" instead
of "apt-cache show".


apt-file
  used for searching for files inside packages

- cat /etc/apt/sources.list - APT uses a list of sources to know where to get packages from. This list is stored in the file

- ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d - Inside the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory you can add files with additional repositories to
  be used by APT, without the need to modify the main /etc/apt/sources.list file.

  



-  dpkg -i PACKAGENAME - Where PACKAGENAME is the name of the .deb file you want to install.
  -  dpkg -i openshot-qt_2.4.3+dfsg1-1_all.deb 
-  dpkg -r unrar - To remove a package, pass the -r parameter to dpkg, followed by the package name.
  - dpkg -P p7zip - . If you want to remove everything associated with the package, use the -P (purge) option instead of -r.
-  dpkg -I google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb - get information about Package
- dpkg --get-selections - To get a list of every package installed on your system, use the --get-selections option
